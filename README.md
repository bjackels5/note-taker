## Requirements
* The app must start at a landing page with a link to a notes page.
* Clicking on the link to the notes page presents the user with a page of existing notes listed in the left hand column, a right hand column that has fields to enter a new note with a title and text, and a navigation bar at the top containing a Write icon.
* After entering a new note title and new note text, a Save icon will appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
* Clicking the Save icon will save the entered title and text and the note will appear in the left hand column with the other existing notes.
* Clicking on an existing note in the left hand list will make the note title and text appear in the right hand column (read only).
* Clicking on the Write icon will clear the fields in the right hand column so the user can enter a new note.
* BONUS: Clicking the delete button will delete the associated note and remove it from the list on the left hand side.

## Technologies Used
* Heroku
* Node.js
* Express
* Bootswatch (based off of bootstrap): I used a different theme than what was in the starter code. The one I selected is more fun than the nice-but-boring one originally used.
* Fontawesome
* json
* Insomnia Core
